### Kotlin

We will most likely use [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/)  as our Programming Language, so you guys might want to check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_oGi8uuDpA) for a quick introduction. If you prefer reading, here are some documentations about Kotlin : 

- [Android Developer Site](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started.html)
- [Kotlin Docs Reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)

### Android Studio

[Android Studio Release Update Site](https://androidstudio.googleblog.com/)

The above site will be useful to track the latest Android Studio Version, as of 11/9/2017 : 
- [Android Studio 2.3.3 - Most stable version](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
- [Android Studio 3.0 beta 5 - Latest preview version](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html)

### OpenDota API

As of 11/09/2017, we will most likely use [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/), though that may change if the backend team created more API for us to play with.

There's also an OpenDota App written in React, you can check it out at the following link  : https://www.dropbox.com/sh/86je8fxw8k9pj7v/AAD3uRKVGj1e8NVC9xaelodqa?dl=0
